## Description:
What is TeamCom?

TeamCom is a multi-purpose app designed for companies and colleges, focusing primarily on improving collaboration, communication and mental well-being in professional environments by providing task and team management tools. 
With the rise of remote working, there is a growing need for applications like TeamCom. TeamCom is a channel-based application similar to Slack or Discord and can be set up by anyone.
Channel users are able to create projects and tasks for these projects, personal and public-shared reminders and public channel events, schedule online or in-person meeting and join meetings. TeamCom also offers conversation functionalities with other channel members. Private and group conversations can be easily created between channel members. 

TeamCom offers personal assistance and advice to all members in all channels and actively looks out for usersâ€™ mental well-being by conducting frequent analyses on meetings, reminders and tasks assigned to users to help with work-life balance.
